# Nix Flakes {#ch-nix-flakes}

Project Manager is compatible with [Nix
Flakes](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes). But please be aware that this
support is still experimental and may change in backwards
incompatible ways.

Just like in the standard installation you can use the Project Manager
flake in one way:

1.  Using the standalone `project-manager` tool. See
    [Standalone setup](#sec-flakes-standalone) for instructions on how
    to perform this installation.
