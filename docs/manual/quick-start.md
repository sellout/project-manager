# Quick Start {#ch-quick-start}

It’s not necessary to install Project Manager to use it for a project. The easiest way to try it out is on a new project, but it’s also intended to be easy to integrate it with an existing project

**NB**: If you have installed Project Manager already, then `nix run github:sellout/project-manager --` can be replaced with `project-manager` in any commands.
