# Preface {#preface}

This manual will eventually describe how to install, use, and extend Project
Manager.

If you encounter problems then please reach out on the IRC channel
[#project-manager](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=project-manager)
hosted by [OFTC](https://oftc.net/).
There is also a [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/%23hm:rycee.net),
which is bridged to the IRC channel.
If your problem is caused by a bug in Project Manager then it should
be reported on the
[Project Manager issue tracker](https://github.com/nix-community/project-manager/issues).

:::{.note}
Commands prefixed with `$ sudo` have to be run as root, either
requiring to login as root user or temporarily switching to it using
`sudo` for example.
