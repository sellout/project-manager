# Preface {#preface}

This manual will eventually describe how to install, use, and extend Project
Manager.

If you encounter problems then please reach out on [the Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/%23project-manager:matrix.org).
If your problem is caused by a bug in Project Manager then it should
be reported on the
[Project Manager issue tracker](https://github.com/nix-community/project-manager/issues).

Commands prefixed with `$ sudo` have to be run as root, either
requiring to login as root user or temporarily switching to it using
`sudo` for example.
