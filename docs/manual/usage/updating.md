# Updating {#sec-updating}

If you have installed Project Manager using the Nix channel method then
updating Project Manager is done by first updating the channel. You can
then switch to the updated Project Manager environment.

```shell
$ nix-channel --update
â€¦
unpacking channels...
$ project-manager switch
```
