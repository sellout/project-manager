# Standalone installation {#sec-install-standalone}

1.  Make sure you have a working Nix installation. Specifically, make
    sure that your user is able to build and install Nix packages. For
    example, you should be able to successfully run a command like
    `nix-instantiate '<nixpkgs>' -A hello` without having to switch to
    the root user. For a multi-user install of Nix this means that your
    user must be covered by the
    [`allowed-users`](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#conf-allowed-users)
    Nix option. On NixOS you can control this option using the
    [`nix.settings.allowed-users`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/options.html#opt-nix.settings.allowed-users)
    system option.

2.  Add the appropriate Project Manager channel. If you are following
    Nixpkgs master or an unstable channel you can run

    ```shell
    $ nix-channel --add https://github.com/sellout/project-manager/archive/master.tar.gz project-manager
    $ nix-channel --update
    ```

    and if you follow a Nixpkgs version 24.05 channel you can run

    ```shell
    $ nix-channel --add https://github.com/sellout/project-manager/archive/release-24.05.tar.gz project-manager
    $ nix-channel --update
    ```

3.  Run the Project Manager installation command and create the first Project
    Manager generation:

    ```shell
    $ nix-shell '<project-manager>' -A install
    ```

    Once finished, Project Manager should be active and available in your
    user environment.

4.  If you donâ€™t plan on having Project Manager manage your shell
    configuration then you must source the

    ```bash
    $HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
    ```

    file in your shell configuration. Alternatively source

    ```bash
    /etc/profiles/per-user/$USER/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
    ```

    when managing home configuration together with system configuration.

    This file can be sourced directly by POSIX.2-like shells such as
    [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) or [Z
    shell](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/). [Fish](https://fishshell.com)
    users can use utilities such as
    [foreign-env](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/plugin-foreign-env) or
    [babelfish](https://github.com/bouk/babelfish).

    For example, if you use Bash then add

    ```bash
    . "$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh"
    ```

    to your `~/.profile` file.

If instead of using channels you want to run Project Manager from a Git
checkout of the repository then you can use the
[project-manager.path](#opt-programs.project-manager.path) option to specify the absolute
path to the repository.

Once installed you can see [Using Project Manager](#ch-usage) for a more detailed
description of Project Manager and how to use it.
