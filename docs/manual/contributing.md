# Contributing {#ch-contributing}

Contributions to Project Manager are very welcome. To make the process as
smooth as possible for both you and the Project Manager maintainers we
provide some guidelines that we ask you to follow. See [Getting
started](#sec-contrib-getting-started) for information on how to set up
a suitable development environment and [Guidelines](#sec-guidelines) for
the actual guidelines.

This text is mainly directed at those who would like to make code
contributions to Project Manager. If you just want to report a bug then
first look among the already [open
issues](https://github.com/sellout/project-manager/issues), if you
find one matching yours then feel free to comment on it to add any
additional information you may have. If no matching issue exists then go
to the [new
issue](https://github.com/sellout/project-manager/issues/new) page
and write a description of your problem. Include as much information as
you can, ideally also include relevant excerpts from your Project Manager
configuration.
