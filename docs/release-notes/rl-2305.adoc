=== Highlights

This release has the following notable changes:

* The `home-manager` tool now offers an `init` command.
This command can be used to generate an initial Home Manager configuration,
and optionally also activate it.
The recommended installation method for a standalone Home Manager setup
with Nix flakes uses this new command.
The standard installation method remains the same but uses the new command internally.
See <<sec-flakes-standalone>> for more.
